## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  
We preformed a [multiple linear regression model]() using RStudio. We calculated r-squared = 0.71 indicating a strong correlation between MPG and listed variables. The slope is not zero and dependent variables contribute to changes in mpg. We reject the null hypothesis (slope is zero and dependent variables do not effect changes in mpg) due to our low p-value = 5.35e-11. The PRr(>|t|) values of vehicle length (PRr(>|t|)=2.60e-12) and ground clearance (PRr(>|t|)=5.21e-8) are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to our linear model. The intercept PRr(>|t|)=5.08e-8 also explains a significant amount of variablitliy in mpg when all other independent variables are zero. Due to the lack of significant variables in our data, we would take caution to not overfit our regression model. Overfitting can decrease our ability to predict and generalize future datasets and regression models, but would show good performance in our current dataset.
